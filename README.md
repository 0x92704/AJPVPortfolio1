Background Images – To be changed in the future but for now I put the images i used in the digital wireframe.
Back to Home Button – Buttons on pages that returns the user to the websites main page.
Back to about button - Button that returns the user to the about page when clicked.
Fixed Watermark – To be changed in the future but this will be my watermark for my works.

Any additional design choices or deviations from the wireframe
Theres not much deviation from the wireframe but the only design choice or a feature that i added that was not in the wireframe are the back to home button
and the extra about button. This buttons will allow the user to return to the previous page without reloading the site again.
